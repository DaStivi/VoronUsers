# This is an X-Carriage with Annex's Mag Probe ("Klicky") + X-Endstop

- The Hybrid Version is desinged for MGN9 on the bottom and MGN12 on the Front of the Extrustion and its made for the Stealthburner

- There's also ah Version for dual MGN9 with the X-Endstop, on this Version i added Hex Nut grooves on the Back where normally the Screwheads for the AB sits, so you can put hexnuts in there, and mount the Stealthburner with longer screws without the need to reprint the X-Carriage

- The third version is for single MGN12 with Annex Probe Magnet slots
