# This is an X-Carriage with Annex's Mag Probe ("Klicky") + X-Endstop

- The Hybrid Version is desinged for MGN9 on the bottom and MGN12 on the Front of the Extrustion and its made for the Stealthburner

- There's also ah Version for dual MGN9 with the X-Endstop, this Version is originally for Afterburner, where Clockwork got screwed from the back of the X-Carriage Frame parts, but you can easily but in ah Hexnut, made hot with ligther or Heatgun, or just melt the whole Hexnut in with Soldering Iron as like you would do it with an heatinsert and you can user it also with the Stealthburner that gets screwed in from the front then!

- The third version is for single MGN12 with Annex Probe Magnet slots

The Magnet Slots are off center intentionally! when you assemble the Microswitch into Annex Switch-Carriage you will see that the klick mechnism of the switch should be centered between the two X-Carriage Frames and aligned with the Nozzle!
