This is an alternative DIN Rail bracket for Bigtreetech Octopus board, posted this way back in Voron Discord just never uploaded it to VoronUser Mods

Use default pcb_din_clip.stl x2, and print two parts and secure with m2 self-tapping screw.

Octopus board can be secured to this bracket with M3 screw, without nuts.
